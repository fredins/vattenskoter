    * what do I want to learn or understand better?
        I want to better understand the agile SCRUM process since I've yet to work with it in any significant way.
        This will most likely happen via practice, and also some additional reading of the course material.
        That is, I think much of the process will be clearer and easier once we've done a sprint or two.

        Additionally, we've disscused which technologies to use in the project and it seems as though we may have to
        use some which I have yet to work with, such as javascript and databases in WIX.
        Because of this I need to get a better understanding of them so that I can contribute to the team effort. 
        I will do this by reading a bit about the documentation of WIX and writing one or two basic programs
        in javascript to get a grip of the syntax and structure.

    * how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
        The I students have said they lack experience in git.
        Because we will use git extensively in the project we, the IT students, will 
        try to help them understand git better by doing a demonstration or two.

    * what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
        I will try my best to use my past experiences from other courses in agile development.

    * what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
        This week I contributed in the making of the social contract.
        The following week I will do the same; that is, be active in all of the things we turn in/deliver.
