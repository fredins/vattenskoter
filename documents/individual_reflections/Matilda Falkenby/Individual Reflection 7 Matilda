What do I want to learn or understand better?
How this course can be so labor intensive when it is a pass/fail course. I am feeling very stressed about contributing as there
is in every sprint not enough user stories for everyone, there is a reason for this but right now I cannot remember it.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as last week, this is still a very hard question, as I feel that the more time that have passed I feel I know less and less 
but learn more and more from others. I am also feeling the pressure to perform although I don't have enough time to perform certain tasks.
This week there was a workshop which I was supposed to attend, but because of scheduling conflicts and misscommunication I could not attend,
which sucked because I think I would have benefitted form being there.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I mainly contribute by doing user stories and participate. This mostly consists of the more simpler tasks as I am studying 150%, 
not familliar with the backend, and there are other people who are better at both Javascript and other frontend tasks than me. 
It is limiting but I am doing my best eventhough sometimes it feels like I am not contributing at all.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Well this week I was helping the team with CSS and helping the platform look nice, however I could not finish as I am blocked by
another user story that needs to be done before I can continue. However, I did the majority of the CSS that was to be done.
This is the only contribution I could do this week, as I am swamped with master thesis stress and deadlines.
