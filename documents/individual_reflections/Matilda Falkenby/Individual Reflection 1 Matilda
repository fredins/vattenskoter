What do I want to learn or understand better?
  How to use Scrum better, how to keep up with the different sprints.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  We use Scrum where I currently work, so I have some experience which I can share with the team.
  I also have experience with learning new programming languages and how long some projects can take, 
  for instance how hard it can be to make an app fast especially if you don't have experience with the programming language.
  And how Apple is very picky with their apps in their app store (although sometimes I wonder)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I have used Scrum before, so I can share my experiences with the team.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  I hope to contribute with my experience within making apps regarding design and with my somewhat experience using Scrum.

Other notes
  I believe we are on track, when discussing the team agreement we all seemed to be on the same page and have somewhat similar 
  expectations of eachother regarding this course.
