What do I want to learn or understand better?
  To understand how to work better with user stories and definition of done.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  Still cannot really help someone better than anyone else in the group, but I am learning Tailwind CSS
  and it's going better than expected.
  
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  This sprint I contributed to planning the sprint, and doing a user story (user story #2.10).

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This sprint I started and finished the user story #2.10 by myself, I learned a lot about Tailwind CSS
  and got to refresh my HTML skills. It was very fun to see how the user story came together.
