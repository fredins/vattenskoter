What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am realizing what it means by working horizontally and vertically and the usefulness of SCRUM. That the first week you lay the
basics of your system working horizontally, then you work vertically for each compontent, so in our case that could for example 
be when adding the SessionEditor one person works on the CSS code, one person on the JS code, one person on the backend code, and 
one person on the database code. Then towards the end of the project you might work a mix of horizontally and vertically by connecting
all components and connecting the backend to the frontend completly. So this is something that I have realized and will hopefully 
start to learn better in how to apply this to my own work.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I don't think I am of any help to anyone, except maybe CSS things, I feel I am the one that learns the most from the others rather than
the other way around. Still feeling the pressure to perform, but I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with this course so my
stresslevels of that is starting to fade.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I mainly contribute by doing user stories and participate. This mostly consists of the more simpler tasks as I am studying 150%, 
not familliar with the backend, and there are other people who are better at both Javascript and other frontend tasks than me. 
It is limiting but I am doing my best eventhough sometimes it feels like I am not contributing at all.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As the user story that was blocking me last week was finished this week I could finish the last of my CSS code for the component.
The rest of the week I have been busy with my master thesis this week also unfortunately, so finishing the CSS code was all I 
could contribute with.
