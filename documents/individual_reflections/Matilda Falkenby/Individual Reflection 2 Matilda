What do I want to learn or understand better?
  How to use Scrum better, still. I want to learn more about how to plan my time better for when I work for real.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  In this particular week we had to make the project scope and the mockup, I have some experience with making mockups so this 
  was easy for me to contribute with. And for rest of the team to perhaps learn about UI kits.
  
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I have knowledge about user stories, however they might not be of the same definition of what a user story is. As my experience 
  come from a UX perspective.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  I made the mockup for this weeks deliverable.
