What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I want to understand user stories better, my understanding of a user story comes from a UX 
  perspective and is probably not the same for user stories used in scrum.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  At the moment I am in need of more help than I can give, as I have never programmed in JavaScript
  and it was a while ago since I programmed in HTML.
  
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  This sprint, when doing the Planning poker for each user story, I contributed by questioning if 
  some effort calculation was too much or too little.
  In this sprint we also encountered an issue of a user story (#2.4) being too dependent on another user story (#2.4) and too complex
  for this sprint, the user story was split up to more indepentent and smaller acceptence criterias.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This sprint me and Kasper worked on the user story #2.4 where we added the different input fields
  for adding an event to the calendar. Due to the package-lock.json file giving us some issues we
  mainly worked and finished the card on Kaspers computer.
