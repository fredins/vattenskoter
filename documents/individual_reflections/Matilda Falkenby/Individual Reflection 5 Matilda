This week I did a user story with Jonas regarding modal views for our web application.
However, due to other happenings within my master thesis and my work we did not complete 
the user story in time. 
The user story revolves around react, which neither I or Jonas has worked with before.
This also slowed down my process as I had to read up on React and how to implement it,
which took some time and I feel I still don't have a clear grasp on how to tackle the
user story.

I wish to understand React better and how to implement it to our code, as I feel that I
am not doing enough when I cannot contribute. Similarly to last week I am still in more
need of help than I feel that I can give, however I think that me and Jonas are helping
eachother with the user story.

In this sprint I have not contributed much at all, not with the team deliverables either 
because I have been super occupied with other things, so this course have been on the 
backburner for this sprint.
However, I hope to contribute more for next week as I want to be a part of this team and
it's success in this course.
