## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how prototyping fits in with an agile workflow and scrum.
It will be interesting to be working with a real client and all the challenges 
that comes with it. I am also really excited to be working with a full stack project
, and all the new technologies that I haven't used yet. Lastly, I want to learn 
from my group members that have taken courses in databases.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I intend to help with the git workshop. I will probably also help the team with
working with general web development stuff if we decide to do a website. 
I might also help with various sysadmin stuff like setting up a server and a database. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I will probably be reviewing pull request (if we decide to use them) to see 
if they fulfil the definition of done. I don't want to be scrum master 
because I feel our team has many better candidates. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I intend to have an overview of the whole project to see if we may need to 
change our approach or limit the scope of our project, so we can present
our client with a good finished product. However, I will also try to limit
the scoop of my own involvement so we can effectively utilise our workforce.

## Other notes
Next week I want to create concrete user stories. I also want to 
plan the project, and make sure the client understands and agrees 
with the plan. I want to establish the workflow for the project
regarding git strategy and definition of done, and perhaps create a small 
boilerplate for the project.

I have one concern regarding testing and how feasible it will be with
our project which relies on a lot of apis and user input.
