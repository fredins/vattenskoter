## What do I want to learn or understand better?
How we should estimate effort for user stories when all the team members
have different areas of "expertise". How to create precise acceptance 
criterias without an complete understanding of all the technicalities, 
which may only be apparent in the pull request review. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I intend to thoroughly document the frontend code in before 
our next sprint.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I have reviewed multiple PRs.
- I attended the spring planning and retrospective (the sprint review is delayed) 
- I have continued to work according to scrum (for example using user stories).

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I finshed user stories #2.11 (leftover from last week), #2.14, and #3.19, and #2.13.2.
We also started creating issues this week. I solved issue #21, #22, and #23.
