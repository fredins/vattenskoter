## What do I want to learn or understand better?
How I am supposed to write tests in agile development with thin vertical user stories.
Seems like making tests will be pointless because in the next sprint the code 
will be iterated upon. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I intend to primary help my team members with working with frontend and react.
I will propably also help a bit with the backend as well.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated on all the meetings. During the meetings I have 
been active and voiced my opinion when feelt strongly about something.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I participated in making the user stories and the project scope. 
I have also been planning and looking at different apis which we might
use in our project.

## Other notes
Next week I am really excited to start the project. 
I want to start the week by on monday by planning: 
  - Which user stories?
  - Who is going to do what?
  - What is our git strategy?
  - What is out definition of done?
