## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint I really wanted the product the reach a usable state. 
In my last reflection I worried that the database and 
server would not be finished in time. However, during this sprint
the server and database where finished quite early which was a relief.
My other worry was the user story concerning our newest view on the 
frontend. This was a story which back then had already been in progress
for two sprints. It was supposed to be done the weekend before this 
latest sprint but instead it progressed the whole last sprint aswell 
(albeit some new features where implemented). Looking back I think 
I should have helped out and get it done after the first sprint. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This sprint I participated in the workshop. I also helped multiple team 
members over discord. Like previous weeks I got help from the guy that 
is in charge of our server code. This time he helped me with for e.g 
correct date timestamps and removing timezones adjustments on the server.
I also recieved help with solving some issues during this weekend, which 
was great and really appreciated.

Many of our members have required a lot of help with unfamiliar tools 
during this project. I thought people would get the hang of it 
after approx. sprint 3 but it took much longer than that. During the   
first reflection I wrote that I wished to limit my own responsibiliites. 
On one hand I achieved my wish because a couple of people took charge 
of the server and the database. On the other hand I didn't manage
to limit my responsibiliites on the frontend. I felt like I had
to attend to every part of the code. I think I should have advocated
for more workshops and more work at school, even if all members couldn't 
attend.
