## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint I was tasked with setting up a webserver to host our website. 
The reason for this was to make it easier to show the progress to our
Stakeholder. The website is up after some unpredicted struggles.There are 
still some inconsistencies with the deploy workflow, and some
problems regarding https only mode in browser settings. A new tool a 
got familliar with was scp (secure copy), which was fun and useful.

Next sprint I want to reach our minimal viable product preferable quite
early in the week. My biggest worry is that the user stories regarding 
the backend and the database wont be finihed in time. I have also some 
concerns regarding our newest view which will hopefully see some good
progress this weekend. 

Considering the final sprint is next week, some user stories are
bound to be dependent on each other. I want to learn how to effectively
navigate that situation, and how to plan for it. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The weekend before this recent sprint I documented all the frontend code 
which lacked documentation, which has been requested by multiple team members.
I also participated in the workshop, where we managed to clear some things up 
and make good progress.

Next week I think it would be smart to take a more active role in assisting 
my team members to make sure no user story is not completed by friday. 
However, I will try to make my intentions clear during the sprint planning so
no one gets upset.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I participated in all the standups.
- I attended the sprint planning and the retrospective (the sprint review is canceled again) 
- I have reviewed multiple PRs.
- I have continued to work according to scrum (for example using user stories).

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- I solved issue #26, #27, #78, #65, #57, and #39.
