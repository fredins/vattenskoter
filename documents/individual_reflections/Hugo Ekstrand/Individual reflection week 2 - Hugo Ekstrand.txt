    * what do I want to learn or understand better?
		I've studied the frameworks we have decided to use so that I can better work on the project when
		the sprints start. 
		
		I will have to freshen up my Java skills since we will most likely set up a server early in the project.
		I think I can freshen up my skills in Java quite quickly simply by reading java documentation and trail and error if
		I work on a user story related this next week.


    * how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
		I seem to have a better understanding about the technical parts of the project than most of my team.
		That is, I seem to better understand how we will make a server, web interface, and communicate with our client's website's API.
		Because of this I've tried to give my inputs on how we can, for example, divide up the project
		by working on different parts of the project's architecture in parallel. 


    * what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
		This week I've helped write preliminary user stories for the first sprints, so that we can select the ones we
		will work on in the first sprint plan. 
		
		In the future I hope to better understand my, and my teams, workflow so that we can work better together
		since there are, inevitably, a few uncertainties since we yet to do a sprint.
		That is, I don't know how well we estimate tasks, who is good at what, and exactly how our project's foundation 
		will or should look. 
		This will, as mentioned in the last reflection, become apparent when we start our first sprint and get
		to working together.


    * what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
		I've been on the meeting where we worked on the project scope and delivered what input I have, even though
		it felt as though the business model was more suited for the I students.
		Continuing I will be on the meetings when we do team reflection, and thus contributing to those deliveries.
