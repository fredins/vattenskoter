##How to run server
There are two ways to run the server:

- Open the project in intellij and click the green arrow "run 'application'"
  or press shift + f10.

- Open a command prompt in the root server directory and type `mvn spring-boot:run`.

Once the server has launched and no error have occurred
either type `curl localhost:8080` in a command prompt or
type `localhost:8080` in the address field of a browser.
