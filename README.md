## About
A calendar scheduling application with a data connection to a Wix website. This application contains:
- an independent Spring-boot java backend server
- a mobile optimized React TS frontend
- and a postgressql database for persistent data

The project is subdivided into the main architectures, where the server folder contains both the Spring server and postgressql database and
the web folder contains the React frontend interface. Both folders contain readmes for how to build and launch the application.

Reflection documents are in /documents and subdivided into individual and team reflection. The social contract and final report can also be found here.
